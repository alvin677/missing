# missing
A package manager written in Rust, useful when tools are *missing*.

## not yet finished gg
example: `missing python`, tool checks if package is installed. if it is, ask to update if there's an available update.
if it's not installed, install the stuff and add to PATH if necessary.

packages that need to be added (cause it sucks to manually install them):

`libclang` `nasm` `cmake`
