# missing
A package manager for Windows, written in Rust. Useful when tools are *missing*.

example: `missing python`, tool checks if package is installed. if it is, ask to update if there's an available update.
if it's not installed, install the installer or whatever and add to PATH if necessary.

packages that need to be added (cause some suck to manually install):

`libclang` `nasm` `cmake`

`python` `node` `rust`

`nvidia`?
