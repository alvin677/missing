# missing
A (terminal) package manager for Windows, written in Rust. Useful when tools are *missing*.

**Usage**<br/>
First off, add the executable to **PATH**:
```bat
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\your\path\here\
```

Then to use the package manager:

`./missing` - will list all available packages<br/>
`./missing <name>` - will download the package<br/>


packages that need to be added (cause some suck to manually install):

`libclang` `nasm` `cmake`

`python` `node` `rust`

`nvidia`?
